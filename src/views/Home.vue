                    "bodyText": "The Home Office failed in its legal duty to counter racial discrimination when it implemented its anti-immigration hostile environment programme, a draft investigation into the causes of the Windrush scandal, commissioned by the department itself, has reportedly found. The damning document accuses officials of recklessness and a reluctance to acknowledge and learn from their mistakes, according to Channel 4 News, which was shown a leaked version of the review. The extracts of the draft report by Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, highlights the Home Office’s failure to admit it was wrong and to issue an unqualified apology. Williams was commissioned to undertake the “Windrush lessons learned” review by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, last summer in the wake of reporting on the scandal by the Guardian. “While everyone I spoke to was rightly appalled by what happened, this was often juxtaposed with a self-justification, either in the form of it was unforeseen, unforeseeable and therefore unavoidable ... or a failure on the part of individuals to prove their status,” Williams wrote, in extracts seen by Channel 4 News. Theresa May introduced a series of hostile environment policies, under which she sought to make life intolerable for people who had illegally entered the UK, in a bid to cut inward immigration numbers during her time as home secretary. Williams’s review focuses on the impact of immigration laws from that period. As a result of this legislation, thousands of people who had been living legally in the UK for decades found themselves wrongly classified as illegal immigrants. Many lost their jobs, were made homeless or denied healthcare and some were detained and deported to countries they had left as children. Judy Griffith, 64, who arrived in the UK from Barbados in 1963 when she was nine and who has worked and paid taxes here for decades, was informed she was an illegal immigrant by Jobcentre officials two years ago. She was unable to work and ineligible for benefits, remains in debt and and has had no compensation or personal apology. She said she was unsurprised by the report’s findings. “The policies were insidious, deliberate, nasty and racist,” she said. “There’s been no proper apology. When you look at the compensation scheme it makes you think they are in no way sorry.” Draft extracts of Williams’ review suggest the implementation of May’s policies was flawed because “it failed to adequately consider the past ... It failed to adequately consider the impact on people ... It also failed to adequately mitigate equalities issues including the potential for discrimination, particularly in housing”. The document reportedly adds that the Home Office failed to effectively evaluate the effectiveness of its policies. “This appears particularly reckless considering the significant warnings that the department was given about their potential consequences.” The shadow women and equalities secretary, Dawn Butler, said the report was “extremely damning” and that the legislation that established the hostile environment was “deliberately discriminatory and racist towards people that were invited to this country and were British citizens”. Her Labour colleague, David Lammy, who has been a vocal campaigner on the issue, demanded that the government scrap the hostile environment policy and said it would be May’s lasting legacy. Williams also describes a “defensive culture that results in an unwillingness to learn from past mistakes” within the Home Office. She reportedly recommends that the department’s staff be educated in the UK’s colonial past and proposes that government ministers should admit that they were wrong and provide an unqualified apology. “Ministers/department should admit that it was wrong and provide an unqualified apology...the sincerity of this apology will be judged by how far the department demonstrates contrition.” Satbir Singh, the chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “This review confirms what we at JCWI have said from the beginning: Windrush was no accident, but the inevitable result of a broken immigration system, driven by the divisive politics of scapegoating and scaremongering. “After today, there is nowhere left to hide. The Tory leadership candidates must pledge to scrap the hostile environment, repeal right to rent [which demands landlords check tenants’ immigration status] and rebuild the immigration system from the ground up. We expect the government to release the full report without delay so that we can begin finally to build a humane, fair and functional immigration system.” A Home Office spokesman said: “We do not comment on leaked documents.”"

                    "bodyText": "Thirteen journalists who were investigating damage to the environment have been killed in recent years and many more are suffering violence, harassment, intimidation and lawsuits, according to a study. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which produced the tally, is investigating a further 16 deaths over the last decade. It says the number of murders may be as high as 29, making this field of journalism one of the most dangerous after war reporting. On every continent reporters have been attacked for investigating concerns about abuses related to the impact of corporate and political interests scrambling to extract wealth from the earth’s remaining natural resources. These resources end up in all manner of products – from mobile phones to pots and pans – with consumers largely unaware of the stories behind them. The study was produced for Green Blood, a reporting project whose aim is to continue the reporting of local environmental journalists who have been forced to abandon their work. Led by Forbidden Stories, a group of 15 media partners, including the Guardian, El País and Le Monde, have come together to shine an international light on the way these activities affect local environments and communities. Last year, the consortium published an investigation into the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. The latest project comes amid repeated warnings of an environmental emergency caused by climate change, which further increases the pressure on already scarce resources. “Environmental issues involve some of the greatest abuses of power in the world and some of the greatest of concentrations of power in the world,” said Bruce Shapiro, the director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma. “I’m hard put to think of a category of investigative reporters who are routinely dealing with more dangerous actors. Investigative reporting on the environment can be as dangerous a beat as reporting on narco smuggling.” The CPJ executive director, Joel Simon, added: “Reporting such stories for national and international media often involves travelling to remote communities and confronting powerful interests. This makes it inherently dangerous. “This is not a new issue, but it has become more acute as climate change has accelerated and environmental change more directly impacts people’s lives. I don’t see that changing any time soon, which is why it is so important to report on environmental issues despite the risk.” Green Blood has focused on the mining industry, with reports from different countries starting on Tuesday. While the journalists identified by CPJ have not been killed in the chosen areas, the behaviour of the police and state security forces has deterred reporters from raising the concerns of local people, meaning there can be an effective news blackout. Over eight months, the Green Blood partners worked with local reporters to gather documents and witness accounts and conduct scientific tests to identify pollution. The first investigation concerns a Tanzanian mine where journalists trying to investigate its activities and relationships found themselves harassed and their stories spiked following pressure from police and state authorities. Reporters have lost their jobs and two newspapers were shut down. The allegations concern villagers being displaced and shot dead by police and security guards. A number of women have spoken of being raped by guards. The second report features a nickel mine. Global demand for this mineral is high because it is used in stainless steel cookware and surgical instruments. Its value is expected to rise exponentially because of its use in eco-friendly electric cars, helping push up prices for all nickel producers. However, hundreds of indigenous Mayan families are paying a high price for its production in Guatemala. They have complained of evictions, criminal prosecutions and water shortages. Reporters raising the alarm have been held under house arrest and forced into hiding to avoid prison. The consortium has also been to south India, where sand mining is a multibillion-dollar industry. Minerals removed from beaches are used in everything from cosmetics to robotics. India is one of the most dangerous places to be a journalist – three of the 13 identified as having been killed in the course of their work since 2009 were from the country. Three more were based in the Philippines. The others died in Panama, Colombia, Russia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. Ramesh Bhushal, project manager with the organisation Earth Journalism, said menaces kept vital information hidden from the public. “What happens is that the journalists are discouraged from writing about those serious issues, and they end up writing about other issues that are easier to cover and they don’t get threats for.” Tanzania has slipped 25 places on the World Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), where it ranks 118th out of 179 countries. “Journalists [in Tanzania] are attacked without reason,” Ryan Powell, a media development specialist working in east and west Africa, told Forbidden Stories. “Police will harass journalists, and people do not interfere.” In south and central America, indigenous reporters are particularly at risk. Guatemala is 116th in the RSF index. Its president, Jimmy Morales, elected in 2016, made a commitment to introduce a national mechanism for the protection of the media soon after winning power, but the initiative has yet to be endorsed by the ministry of the interior."

                    "bodyText": "“Racism in universities is widespread, widely tolerated and raising it carries considerable risk.” These are the words of a senior lecturer who is one of more than 240 staff and students who contacted the Guardian to share their experiences of racism in the UK higher education sector. Their comments combine to paint a damning picture of black and minority ethnic experiences in British universities. Complaints range from overt racism, including assaults, monkey chants, the N-word and other verbal abuse, to institutional and structural racism, indirect racial discrimination and microaggressions. They come from across the higher education spectrum, from senior academics who complain of years of discrimination, to undergraduates starting out on their studies. The universities mentioned include many Russell Group and other top ranked institutions, but the issues are clearly sector-wide. For some, their experiences have had a lasting impact on their mental health. Counselling services are often ill-equipped to support victims of racism, with few counsellors from minority ethnic backgrounds. “I attempted suicide after continuously being racially harassed,” said one British Asian architecture graduate who lodged a complaint about one of his tutors. “He would pretend not to understand my presentations and graded my work much lower than other lecturers. He said if you spoke like [a particular white student] spoke you’d get a higher mark.” No one responded to his emails when he tried to raise the issue with his department. “Student services dismissed and downplayed my concerns. The welfare officer claimed the lecturer marked fairly and suggested I was not capable of being at university. The whole department is in denial and they try to take the side of the racist rather than eliminate the issue.” A black student studying for a PhD at a top university took to her bed for days after sustained racism from fellow students and staff, both in the course of her studies and casual racism in everyday conversations. “It was deeply traumatic. I was making plans to complete suicide. All of it was too much.” A number of contributors said their complaints were played down or shut down entirely. Some of those who made allegations of racism found themselves under attack, with the university closing ranks to protect senior white staff and institutional reputation. One black member of staff at a highly regarded London university who lodged an allegation of race discrimination told the Guardian that after her complaint was dismissed the tables were turned and she ended up facing a charge of gross misconduct. “This is not a hospitable or welcoming environment for minorities,” said a member of staff and former student at an elite English university. “The message is clear: assimilate and shut up – you’re lucky to be here. It is an absolutely poisonous and demeaning environment to work in.” Exasperation at the inability of institutions to acknowledge and effectively tackle racism is shared by the majority of the 264 readers who responded. “I think my university handles racism the way most universities do. By not doing anything until they absolutely have to,” a second year social sciences student said. “People have the view that if you complain about racism, you have some how overreacted or misunderstood what happened,” said a London postgraduate student. “You have to fight to get your voice heard and in most cases you have to take your fight to the highest level before anyone listens to you.” \ufeff“The university handles racism terribly,” said a graduate from a popular Russell Group institution. “There have been several racist incidents and the only way to get a result was by posting on Twitter/Facebook and them going viral.” There are many complaints about racist behaviour by students. “In spring 2018 a group of white students came up to me and my boyfriend and started jumping around like monkeys and calling us niggers. I felt like there was nothing I could do,” said one. Another describes a student union president shouting abusive racial slurs at a new African student and a white male student repeatedly asking a black female student if he could call her “his nigga”. “Another time one of the white girls in our house made a huge pot of food for everyone and shouted: ‘I hope you’re all starving like Africans.’ Me and the only other black person I lived with were dumbfounded.” There are also complaints about academic staff. “In my final year at university, my dissertation supervisor wrote in the comments of my dissertation that I should have gotten my work proofread by a ‘native English speaker’,” said one contributor. “I only speak one language fluently, which is English. I am black but 100% British, born and bred. How much more British must I be before I am considered ‘native’?” More than 170 respondents complained about the lack of diversity among academic staff at their university. Some described a sense of isolation because of the absence of any shared lived experience with those teaching them.. A third-year languages student at one of the most select universities said: “My experiences of racism have been very bad. From small things like a lack of diversity in my lecturers and fellow students (I am yet to have a lecturer of colour), to larger things such as being called the N-word in the street, and students dressing up in blackface and not being adequately reprimanded for it.” A 24-year-old student at a leading art and design college said: “I was told by one tutor that I wasn’t as intelligent as my peers and that I must eat KFC because I am a black woman. I record every conversation I have with staff as I do not feel safe around them.” One PhD student at a top English university who was born in China described her shock at “how white” her university campus is, particularly in comparison with her earlier studies at American universities which she found much more mixed ethnically and socially. “I’m often the only person of colour in the room,” she said. “They expect I have nothing to say and they are shocked when I do. The faculty is all white British and mostly mediocre. The curriculum is white, and hardly decolonised. And most of the students are, of course, white.” Attempts to raise concerns about lack of diversity among academic staff and in the curriculum are often slapped down. “The issue is dismissed as a non-issue,” said a British Kurd who graduated from a leading London university. “The response is – ‘pipe down, shut up and put up’. Or, ‘progress is happening – why don’t you appreciate what’s happening now?’” \ufeffUniversity workers from minorities complained of earning less and being overlooked for jobs. “There’s an 18% pay gap between white and BME staff,” a female research fellow at a northern university said. “Despite being on a prestigious fellowship, I was put on a pay grade two levels below a white male colleague in a similar research role, despite having more research experience, publications and grants to my name. This means I earn about £1,200 less than him annually. “The racism runs down from the top,” she added, “and is upheld by a system of cadreship run by a few older white men and the complicit white women and brown corporate faces they hire to bar meaningful action toward race-based equality.” An academic with years of experience described what happened when he lodged a complaint. “At every stage the equal opportunities team seemed to prioritise protecting the institution over engaging with the complaint … Panels of senior professors hearing cases see their role as defusing, rather than remedying, and ultimately protect their own.”\ufeff"

                    "bodyText": "The Queensland environment department may have acted “unlawfully” when it approved of Adani’s groundwater plan, in the process backing down on a longstanding requirement that the miner provide definitive proof about the source of an ancient desert spring. Environmental groups are now considering a legal challenge to the approval, partly because the state’s Department of Environment and Science (DES) appeared to negotiate a last-minute compromise with Adani rather than applying strict conditions. The DES insisted on Friday that it had not changed its position when granting approval for Adani’s groundwater dependent ecosystems management plan – the final hurdle that will allow the company to begin construction of the Carmichael coalmine. But documents obtained by Guardian Australia, and an email sent by a DES spokesman on 9 April, indicate that the department softened its interpretation of a key requirement in the politically charged weeks before clearing the proposal. The email of 9 April says the department believed the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia had highlighted “uncertainties” about whether Adani had identified the source aquifer of the Doongmabulla Springs complex. “Based on the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia report, it would appear that a number of uncertainties remain, including whether the (groundwater plan) definitively identifies the source aquifers of the Doongmabulla Springs Complex, which has always been a requirement for state approval,” the email says. Four days after the federal election, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, insisted on a timeframe for DES to make a decision about the groundwater plan. When the clock ran out on 13 June, Adani’s plan was approved, and DES had subtly changed its language. It said Adani had “sufficiently” identified the “main source aquifer”. The miner’s conditions require it to identify the “source aquifer(s)”. DES said its decision to approve the management plan was made after it received legal advice. It also took into account additional advice from the federal science agencies, received on 7 June, which said that “some level of uncertainty” would always exist with conceptual groundwater models. As part of the approved plan, Adani has committed to future work to “improve the understanding of source aquifers”. But environmental groups say the condition required Adani to identify the source of the springs before any groundwater plan could be approved; and that the process was designed to safeguard the springs from potential damage caused by the drawdown of groundwater during construction or mining operations. On 11 June, two days before the approval was announced, Lock the Gate wrote to DES saying it would be “unlawful” to approve of Adani’s groundwater plan because expert advice clearly outlined that the source aquifers had not been established. “By pressuring [DES] into approving the water plan without doing the required research and identifying beyond doubt the source aquifer for the Doongmabulla Springs Complex, Adani and the Queensland Government have found themselves in legally questionable territory,” Lock the Gate campaign coordinator Carmel Flint said. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s Stop Adani campaigner Christian Slattery said the group was considering the decision and examining legal avenues available. “(The process) seems to show how politics has completely trumped science and the Queensland government has sold out the long-term interests of regional communities, traditional owners, and the environment,” he said. “The watering down of that interpretation of that environmental authority condition is a clear demonstration of how the government is afraid to stand up to big mining corporations.” Slattery said the groundwater plan deferred critical scientific research until after mining would commence and “when irreversible impacts may already have occurred”. A DES spokesman said the department’s assessment of Adani’s various plans had “always been rigorous and based on the best available science”. “As the independent regulator, the department made its own decision after receiving Adani’s final version of the (groundwater plan) on 12 June, which addressed previous feedback the department had given. “The department and Adani met regularly … to ensure the plan was robust and provided the maximum environmental protection.”"

                    "bodyText": "One of the architects of Theresa May’s “hostile environment” immigration policies, which led to hundreds of West Indian migrants being wrongly denied benefits and deported, was among the former prime minister’s staff handed honours. Glyn Williams, who was the Home Office’s head of migration policy between 2010 and 2013, when the policies were developed, was made a knight commander of the order of Bath. He was one of 10 Home Office staff named in the Queen’s birthday honours, revealed just hours after May stepped down as Tory leader. A group of more than 80 MPs last month referred the Home Office to the equalities watchdog over the hostile environment, requesting an investigation into whether the “deeply discriminatory” policies represented institutional racism. Stephen Doughty, a Labour MP who sits on the Commons home affairs committee, said: “It will be galling to victims of the Windrush scandal and other mess-ups in the Home Office over the past decade to see officials who oversaw these scandals rewarded so handsomely.” Tim Farron, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, told the Mirror the honour was “one final insult” to the victims of the hostile environment policies, after he “presided over a litany of mistakes and scandals at the Home Office that saw far too many innocent people detained, deported and denied their rights”. Williams is director-general of the borders, immigration and citizenship systems policy and strategy group at the Home Office. He sat alongside the former home secretary Amber Rudd, who succeeded May in the role, during her home affairs committee grilling in which she claimed that the department had no targets for deportations. Rudd was forced to resign after documents emerged showing that the Home Office had set a target in 2015 of 12,000 voluntary departures of people regarded as having no right to stay in the UK – a 60% increase on the previous year. The revelation prompted concerns that immigration officials may have been under so much pressure to meet the target that legal migrants who struggled to prove their status could have been caught up in the crackdown. A government spokesman said honours were routinely awarded to public sector employees."

                    "bodyText": "Jonathan Freedland (The secret to stopping Brexit: keep it simple, 11 May) refers to the urgency of climate change and points out, correctly, that this situation “cries out for cooperation with our neighbours”. But his logic is adrift when he links this with his wish for continued British membership of the EU. Firstly, such cooperation could happen via one of the other Europe-wide bodies of which the UK is a member, or via an intergovernmental group specific to that problem; there is no need for it to happen through the EU specifically or any such top-down supranational body. Secondly, some of the EU’s core policies, such as economic growth and expanded continent-wide trading, are simply incompatible with what’s needed to stop the destruction of our ecosystem. There’s nothing inconsistent about supporting more urgent cooperation between neighbouring countries while opposing the principles and the policies of the EU – which is merely one particular political manifestation of such cooperative ideals, and a rather misguided one at that. Albert Beale London • Overfishing and damaging catch methods are the greatest threats to our oceans, and I commend George Monbiot for highlighting the issue (How to halt the greatest threat to the oceans? Stop eating fish, 9 May). But I disagree with his solutions. Up to 26m tonnes of fish caught annually are estimated to be illegal, unreported or unregulated. Bringing fisheries under sustainable management is essential to prevent the collapse of marine ecosystems. Governments have struggled to manage this global problem, but visit fisheryprogress.org and you will see how global fishing firms have worked with NGOs, regional authorities and vessel owners to establish regulations. Seafood companies have the resources to get everyone around the table to spur improvements. With their purchasing power, they can drive compliance with regulations. These rules not only support the recovery of overfished species, but also, as Monbiot notes, will ensure we have a healthy supply of seafood for generations to come. Darian McBain Global director of corporate affairs and sustainability, Thai Union • George Monbiot asserts that “even inshore fisheries are disastrously managed, through a combination of lax rules and a catastrophic failure to enforce them”. Inshore fisheries (0-6 nautical miles) are managed by 10 Inshore Fisheries &amp; Conservation Authorities (Ifcas). Devon &amp; Severn Ifca has an enforcement team and vessels fitted with forward-looking infrared cameras for distant observation. It has pioneered an inshore vessel monitoring system, mandatory for trawlers and scallop dredgers in our district. Between 2016 and 2018, Devon &amp; Severn Ifca investigated 96 enforcement cases, and issued 28 warnings, three cautions and 25 penalties totalling £20,000. Fourteen cases were prosecuted, eight of which received fines of over £93,000. It has pioneered a system of permitting bylaws, allowing the management of trawling, netting, potting and diving for shellfish through 253 new measures. The work done by Dorset &amp; Severn Ifca shows that disastrous management and catastrophic failure of enforcement is not endemic. Prof Michael Williams Deputy chair, Devon &amp; Severn Ifca • I was disappointed to see no coverage of the Mothers Rise Up climate march held in London on Sunday. It did not have any headline-grabbing civil disobedience or arrests, nor a well-known figurehead. But thousands of families came out in great numbers from across the UK, many with young children in tow, and marched, closing central London streets from Hyde Park to Parliament Square for a number of hours. There was a diverse range of speakers touching on pollution, worldwide women’s leadership in environmental movements and the shared weight of responsibility we hold. Please do not disregard the quiet power of women organising, as we may well be the key to sorting this mess out.

                    "bodyText": "Public concern about the environment has soared to record levels in the UK since the visit of Greta Thunberg to parliament and the Extinction Rebellion protests in April. The environment is now cited by people as the third most pressing issue facing the nation in tracking data from the polling company YouGov that began in 2010. Environment was ranked after Brexit and health, but is ahead of the economy, crime and immigration. Young people rate environmental problems such as the climate crisis and global annihilation of wildlife even higher, placing them second behind Brexit. Almost half of 18- to 24-year-olds chose environmental issues as one of the nation’s three most pressing concerns, compared with 27% of the general population. A similar surge in public anxiety has taken place in Germany, where the Green party performed particularly well in the European parliament elections last month. Across the EU, the number of Green MEPs increased by 40% to 69, making them the fourth-largest grouping. In the UK, the number of Green MEPs rose from three to seven and the party won more votes than the Conservatives. Thunberg, the Swedish teenager whose solo school strike for climate action helped create a global movement, told MPs in April that the UK government’s active support for fossil fuels and airport expansion was “beyond absurd”. She added: “This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind.” Extinction Rebellion activists also mounted a week of high-profile protests, mainly in the capital, in which roads were blocked and more than 1,000 people were arrested. On 1 May, MPs endorsed a Labour motion to declare a formal climate and environment emergency. The previous record high for the environment in the YouGov tracking data was 23% in February 2014, following extreme winter storms and flooding in Somerset Levels and other parts of the south of England. But the concern did not outlast the poor weather, with the number of people worried about the environment falling by half within two weeks. Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, said: “Nearly half of the young people of the UK are putting the environment among their top concerns, and no wonder. They can see governments making decisions about their future that take no account of our climate emergency. “In sounding the alarm about the state of our environment, we are the party on the right side of history. Now we are aiming to step up to lead the action in this national emergency.”"
